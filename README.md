# BTE-Revived-Nocore
Barotrauma Extended modified to not be a core package and thus immune to future updates.

This is a fork of the once-popular XML modification Barotrauma Extended for the game Barotrauma. 
This fork alters filepaths and reimplements missing images from Bo0g1eMaN's fork of BTE to make it work without being a core package.
It also fixes general bugs that were unaddressed in the aforementioned fork.

# Installation
To install, simply download the repository (clone, or use the button on the top right), remove the "BTE" folder from within and drag it into `Barotrauma/Mods`.
The final directory will look like `Barotrauma/Mods/BTE/`.
