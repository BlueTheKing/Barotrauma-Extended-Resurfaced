Barotrauma Extended modified to not be a core package and thus highly resistant to future updates.

This is a fork of hubismal's No Core modification of BTE-Revived by Lyfield for the game Barotrauma. 
This fork alters filepaths and reimplements missing images from Bo0g1eMaN's fork of BTE to make it work without being a core package.
It also fixes general bugs that were unaddressed in the aforementioned fork.
In addition, this is also a repo for which the people who are directly involved in the development for Barotrauma Extended - Revived's Steam Workshop page.
The original fork by hubismal is here: https://github.com/hubismal/BTE-Revived-Nocore
